# 🌍 Digital Civilization Simulator

This project is the foundation for a digital civilization simulation, written in Python. It focuses on generating a rich 2D environment using procedural noise — including elevation, temperature, and moisture maps.

The current version implements world generation and visualization, serving as the base for future layers such as autonomous agents, biomes, and dynamic ecosystems.

> This is not a game engine or simulation yet — it's a carefully architected foundation for an emergent civilization sandbox.
